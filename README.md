# CLI Week

Welcome to the 2023 CLI week repository!

The CLI Week is a week in which participants have fun coding a CLI tool.
At the end of the week, a jury selected the "best" 3 projects as the winners.
The only prize is a certificate, so the event is really to have fun with
each other!

## Who can participate?
